## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Airport E-Boarding System database implementation. The system is designed to manage passenger reservations, ticket issuance, baggage handling, and additional services for an airport's e-boarding operations.

## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements

1. **Passenger Management**
   - Store and retrieve passenger information
   - Track passenger meal preferences
   - Manage passenger contact details

2. **Flight Management**
   - Track flight schedules
   - Monitor flight occupancy
   - Manage flight routes

3. **Reservation System**
   - Create and manage reservations
   - Track reservation status
   - Handle seat preferences

4. **Ticket Issuance**
   - Generate e-boarding numbers
   - Issue tickets with fare information
   - Assign seats to passengers

5. **Baggage Management**
   - Track checked-in baggage
   - Calculate baggage fees
   - Monitor baggage status

6. **Additional Services**
   - Offer extra baggage options
   - Provide upgraded meal services
   - Allow preferred seat selection

7. **Employee Management**
   - Track employee performance
   - Manage employee roles and permissions
   - Monitor revenue generation by employee

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Data Integrity**
   - Ensure referential integrity across tables
   - Validate data entry
   - Prevent duplicate records

2. **Security**
   - Protect sensitive passenger information
   - Secure employee credentials
   - Control access to different system functions

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize query performance
   - Efficiently handle concurrent operations
   - Minimize database response time

4. **Usability**
   - Provide intuitive stored procedures
   - Create helpful views for common operations
   - Implement user-friendly functions

## Database Design

### Design Decisions

1. **Normalization to 3NF**
   - **First Normal Form (1NF)**: All tables have atomic values and a primary key
   - **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: All non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key
   - **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: No transitive dependencies exist

2. **Table Structure**
   - **Employees**: Stores employee information with role-based access
   - **Passengers**: Contains passenger details with unique PNR identifiers
   - **Flights**: Manages flight schedules and routes
   - **Reservations**: Links passengers to flights with status tracking
   - **Tickets**: Stores ticket information with e-boarding numbers
   - **Baggage**: Tracks baggage details and fees
   - **AdditionalServices**: Manages extra services purchased by passengers

3. **Key Design Choices**
   - Used PNR as a unique identifier for passengers
   - Separated baggage and additional services into different tables
   - Created a comprehensive reservation system with status tracking
   - Implemented e-boarding number generation for tickets

### Assumptions

1. **Business Rules**
   - Each passenger has a unique PNR
   - Each flight has a unique flight number
   - Each ticket has a unique e-boarding number
   - Reservations cannot be made for past dates
   - Arrival time must be after departure time
   - Meal preferences are limited to vegetarian or non-vegetarian
   - Baggage status can be either 'checkedin' or 'loaded'
   - Additional services are limited to 'extra baggage', 'upgraded meal', or 'preferred seat'
   - Ticket classes are limited to 'business', 'firstclass', or 'economy'
   - Reservation status can be 'confirmed', 'pending', or 'cancelled'
   - Employee roles are limited to 'Ticketing Staff' or 'Ticketing Supervisor'

2. **Technical Assumptions**
   - SQL Server is the database management system
   - T-SQL is the query language
   - The system will be used by airport staff for e-boarding operations
   - The database will be accessed by multiple users concurrently
